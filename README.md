## Usage

```
  npm install
  npm start
```

**Note : Please make sure your MongoDB is running.** For MongoDB installation guide see [this](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/installation/). Also `npm3` is required to install dependencies properly.

## Available Commands

1. `npm run start` - starts the development server with hot reloading enabled

2. `npm run bs` - bundles the code and starts the production server

3. `npm run test` - start the test runner

4. `npm run watch:test` - start the test runner with watch mode

5. `npm run cover` - generates test coverage report

6. `npm run lint` - runs linter to check for lint errors

## File Structure

### Webpack Configs

TotoApp uses Webpack for bundling modules. There are four types of Webpack configs provided `webpack.config.dev.js` (for development), `webpack.config.prod.js` (for production), `webpack.config.server.js` (for bundling server in production) and `webpack.config.babel.js` (for [babel-plugin-webpack-loaders](https://github.com/istarkov/babel-plugin-webpack-loaders) for server rendering of assets included through webpack).

The Webpack configuration is minimal and beginner-friendly. You can customise and add more features to it for production build.

### Server

TotoApp uses the express web application framework. Our app sits in `server/server.js` where we check for `NODE_ENV`.

If NODE_ENV is development, we apply Webpack middlewares for bundling and Hot Module Replacement.

### Client

The client directory contains all the shared components, routes, modules.

#### components
This folder contains all the common components which are used throughout the project.

#### index.js
Index.js simply does client side rendering using the data provided from `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.

## Misc

### ES6 support
We use babel to transpile code in both server and client with the `stage-0` plugin. So, you can use both ES6 and experimental ES7 features.

### Docker
There are docker configurations for both development and production.

To run docker for development,
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up
```

To run docker for production,
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
